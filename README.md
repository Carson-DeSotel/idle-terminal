# idle-term

The original thought behind this repo was to create some sort of "idle game" that would play in your terminal.
Examples of idle game's I would mimic include Cookie Clicker, AdVenture Capitalist, and so many more on the App Store (or Google Play Store). 

Instead of doing that all the way so far, I've instead started work on a graphics library to handle this and have been getting familiar with ANSI escape codes to manipulate color (more experiments in that [here](https://github.com/Carson-DeSotel/terminal-art)) and the cursor position within the terminal. 

Also, it was a fun project to attempt while I've got nothing else going on in the week before the new semester starts.

## Up Next:
I would like to continue the project. I'm hoping to pick up a few things in a class I'm taking this semester to introduce multithreading into the project as well as better C practices.

I would also greatly enjoy expanding out the library to make it a) more accessible and b) more programmatic. I'm a damn TA, I talk to my students so much about employing good coding practices, but apparently can't introduce them too well on my own.

Yeah...

Some goals would be to:
  - Implement a way to incrementally gain points, spend those points, and continue to earn upgrades.
  - Flesh out the graphics library with comments, more functions, better naming conventions.
  - Rework the build system (consider adding a separate build directory)

Let's see if I can finish this off a bit more. If not, I still believe that this stands as a pretty decent representation of what I could accomplish.
