# idle-term

a game to play in your terminal with your extra processing power!

## Description:
```idle-term``` is a game created to be played passively. It is an incremental (or idle) game that uses executions of the code to increase its progress. 

The goal of this incremental game is the same as all incremental games: to make big numbers. 
The way it works is by having progress bars appear on screen. The more you execute the code, the more levels you have, the more bars appear on screen. Each bar takes more time to complete than the last creating some sense of "difficulty". 

There is a hard cap on levels presently (50). 

## Goals:
The next few steps of the game call for adding certain flags that will modify the gamestate to allow for such things as:
  - modifying the color of your progress bars
  - changing your filename
  - adding some sort of "encrpytion" system to the save files to make them harder to crack (no cheaters)
  - adding the ability to run the game infinitely instead of running it after each level beat
  - removing the cap on levels
  - [~] adding beat times
  - [~] randomizing the times to complete a level slightly?
  - [~] modifiers that change the gamestate for the user?

NOTE: items marked with ```[~]``` are of less importance. They're currently just ideas for the future.
